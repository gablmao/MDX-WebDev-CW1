                    <p> 100 years has long passed since the last time rats have infested your town. 
                        A group of brave cats, more known as the Purr-ice Force, Fought back the rat attack and 
                        eventually came victorious. Since then, everything was at peace and harmony...
                    </p>
                    <p> After a hard day's work of slightly irritating your owners, scratching 
                        furniture for no particular reason and meowing loudly at unreasonable times,
                        you go for your well-deserved rest. </p>
                    <p> Until... </p>
                    <p> You were suddenly woken up by the sound of chaos outside your cheeky
                         British house.</p>
                    <p> HOLY <span> WACKAMOLY! </span> Rats Everywhere! A Rat Infestation! And not just the typical normal 
                        house rats this time... </p>

                    <p> Possibly Top 5 of one of the biggest annoyances in British homes
                        (no im not saying this from experience), they've come back for 
                    revenge! </p>
                    <p> This time, a mysterious mutation occurred whilst they were gone, 
                        so more annoying yet unique types of rats have been birthed, yet still 
                        with the same purpose as any other rats... 
                        <span> Wreak havoc, and become more annoying! </span>
                    </p>
                    <p> Be wary, newbie purrster, be prepared of tricks those pesky rats have 
                        under their tail...
